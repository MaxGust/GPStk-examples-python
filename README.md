# GPSTk Python Examples

Examples of using 
[GPSTk](https://github.com/SGL-UT/GPSTk) 
from Python.
The examples included by GPSTk are somewhat broken for Python.
Some 
[examples](http://www.gpstk.org/pythondoc/examples.html) 
were originally written for GPSTk 2.2, but we fixed them to work with GPSTk 2.10.
